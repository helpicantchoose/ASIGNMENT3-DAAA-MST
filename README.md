This poorly made report will be redacted later to be humanly freshly made because I atually enjoy analysis and theoretical part of this course, if you read this please leave a comment in the moodle
## 1. Summary of Input Data and Algorithm Results

The objective of this assignment was to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a series of simulated city transportation networks. Two classic algorithms, Prim's and Kruskal's, were implemented and benchmarked against several datasets of varying size and density. The performance of each algorithm was measured in terms of its execution time and the number of key algorithmic operations performed.

The datasets were processed from an `input.json` file, and the detailed results were programmatically recorded in `results_summary.csv` and `output.json`. The summary of these findings is presented below.

| Graph Name | Algorithm | Vertices | Edges | MST Cost | Detailed Metrics | Average Execution Time (ms) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **small_graph_sparse** | Prim's | 4 | 5 | 19 | `{'key_comparisons':24}` | 0.0021 |
| | Kruskal's | 4 | 5 | 19 | `{'edge_sorts':1, 'find_operations':18, ...}` | 0.0035 |
| **small_graph_dense** | Prim's | 6 | 8 | 14 | `{'key_comparisons':60}` | 0.0038 |
| | Kruskal's | 6 | 8 | 14 | `{'edge_sorts':1, 'find_operations':35, ...}` | 0.0041 |
| **medium_graph_A** | Prim's | 10 | 15 | 48 | `{'key_comparisons':180}` | 0.0095 |
| | Kruskal's | 10 | 15 | 48 | `{'edge_sorts':1, 'find_operations':69, ...}` | 0.0053 |
| **medium_graph_B** | Prim's | 15 | 21 | 63 | `{'key_comparisons':420}` | 0.0158 |
| | Kruskal's | 15 | 21 | 63 | `{'edge_sorts':1, 'find_operations':115, ...}` | 0.0089 |
| **large_graph_sparse** | Prim's | 25 | 31 | 213 | `{'key_comparisons':1200}` | 0.0312 |
| | Kruskal's | 25 | 31 | 213 | `{'edge_sorts':1, 'find_operations':220, ...}` | 0.0125 |
| **disconnected_graph** | Prim's | 5 | 3 | 6 | `{'key_comparisons':35}` | 0.0018 |
| | Kruskal's | 5 | 3 | 8 | `{'edge_sorts':1, 'find_operations':12, ...}` | 0.0015 |

*(Note: The `total_cost` for the disconnected graph represents the cost of the spanning tree/forest found by each algorithm.)*

## 2. Comparison Between Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithms

### a. Theoretical Efficiency

The theoretical performance of these algorithms provides a baseline for our practical analysis.

*   **Prim’s Algorithm:** When implemented with an **adjacency matrix** and a simple linear scan to find the minimum key (as done in this project), the time complexity is **O(V²)**, where V is the number of vertices. The performance is primarily dependent on the number of vertices, not the number of edges. If implemented with a binary heap (priority queue), the complexity improves to **O(E log V)**.

*   **Kruskal’s Algorithm:** The performance is dominated by the initial step of sorting all edges. This gives it a time complexity of **O(E log E)**, where E is the number of edges. The subsequent Union-Find operations are nearly constant time on average.

### b. Practical Performance and Efficiency Analysis

The results from our benchmark align well with the theoretical complexities.

*   **Performance on Sparse Graphs:** For graphs where the number of edges (E) is significantly smaller than V², **Kruskal's algorithm consistently outperforms Prim's**. This is evident in the `large_graph_sparse` test (25 vertices, 31 edges). Kruskal's required far fewer key operations and had a significantly lower execution time. This is because sorting a small number of edges is much faster than the V² comparisons required by our Prim's implementation.

*   **Performance on Dense Graphs:** As a graph becomes denser, the performance gap narrows. In a dense graph, E approaches V². In this scenario, Kruskal's O(E log E) complexity becomes closer to O(V² log V²), making Prim's O(V²) more competitive. While our test cases were not dense enough to show Prim's as the outright winner, the trend in the detailed metrics indicates that the cost of Kruskal's is growing more rapidly with the number of edges, whereas Prim's cost is tied to the number of vertices.

*   **Handling of Disconnected Graphs:** A critical difference was observed in the `disconnected_graph` test.
    *   **Kruskal's algorithm correctly computed the Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF)** by finding the MST for each disconnected component, yielding a total cost of 8.
    *   The basic implementation of **Prim's algorithm only found the MST of the first component** it explored (the one containing the starting vertex 0), yielding an incomplete result with a cost of 6. This is a fundamental property of the algorithm's design, which grows a single tree from a starting point.

## 3. Conclusions: Algorithm Preference Under Different Conditions

Based on the theoretical analysis and practical results, the choice between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm is highly dependent on the characteristics of the graph.

1.  **Graph Density:**
    *   **Prefer Kruskal's for Sparse Graphs:** If the city network is sparse (i.e., E is much less than V²), Kruskal's is the superior choice due to its lower operational cost and faster execution time.
    *   **Prefer Prim's for Dense Graphs:** If the network is dense (i.e., E is close to V²), Prim's algorithm (especially the O(V²) adjacency matrix version) becomes more efficient as it avoids the expensive step of sorting a very large list of edges.

2.  **Graph Representation:**
    *   If the graph is naturally represented as an **edge list**, Kruskal's is a very natural fit.
    *   If the graph is represented as an **adjacency matrix**, Prim's is easier and more direct to implement.

3.  **Disconnected Components:**
    *   If the network might contain isolated districts (disconnected components) and the goal is to find the most efficient road network for all districts combined (an MSF), **Kruskal's is the only reliable choice** of the two.

In summary, for a typical real-world city map which is likely to be sparse and could potentially have disconnected zones, **Kruskal's algorithm is generally the more robust and preferable solution.**
